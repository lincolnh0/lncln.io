## Summary

Recently, I have been battling a nasty bug in one of my up and coming project (it is still unresolved :sob:). And frankly, it has been slowly degrading my mental health. So imagine my surprise when one of my colleagues introduced me to "Advent of Code".

Advent of code is an advent calendar of puzzles that releases a problem daily. They have a running Christmas theme and story and gets progressively harder as we approach Christmas. If you do get stuck, the dedicated subreddit has tons of helpful tips and memes to get you through these trying times.

I have been added to a private leaderboard with my colleagues where we can share and discuss our solutions.


I don't consider this an active project but I have created a respository to track all my solutions [here](https://github.com/lincolnh0/advent-2024).
