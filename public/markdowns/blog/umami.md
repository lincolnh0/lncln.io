## Umami

My side project track record has always been creating a very specific solution for a deeply personal problem.
This means I am rarely invested in the popularity of the project.

However, lately I have been working on the [daily scramble](https://scramble.lncln.io/) and having added an
authentication system, I wanted to see my users' activity.

I came across [umami](https://umami.is/) a while back and decided to give it a try.

The setup was easy and the dashboard is clean and simple, it is GDPR compliant and does not track personal data out of the box.

I am happy with the results so far and I am considering using it for my other projects.
