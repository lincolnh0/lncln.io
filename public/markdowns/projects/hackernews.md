## Summary

Hackernews is an online forum hosted by Y-combinator. It serves as a space where technology enthusiasts and software developers can discuss innovations and showcase various personal or even start-up projects.

Being a frequent visitor of the site, I decided to utilise their recently published API to build a static site to polish up my Javascript knowledge. The framework of choice was Next.js with MaterialUI as the accompanying components library. There were some initial bumps I ran into when integrating them but this guide helped point me in the right direction.

Hosting wise, it was fairly straightforward, I linked my repository to Netlify and it automatically deploys on all commits.
