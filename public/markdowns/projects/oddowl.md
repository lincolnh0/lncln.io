## Summary
With multiple sports back in full swing after Christmas, the sports betting and gambling industry will continue to make profits off die-hard sports fans and adrenaline junkies.

With events such as the SuperBowl and March Madness coming up, I dove head first into the world of sports betting and was overwhelmed by the amount of bookmakers promotions, betting strategies and just pure chaotic information out there.

OddOwl is therefore created to filter out all the bloat and deliver the essentials of what you are really after, the best odds of any given match.

Using the [Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/), OddOwl aggregates your region's bookmakers and identify the best odds. In some rare cases, there is also this strategy called Arbitrage betting, where regardless of the outcome of the match, a profit can be made through a careful split of stake.

This project acted as my introduction to VueJs and as StackOverflow's developer survey would suggest, I have had a wonderful experience onboarding this framework compared to when I first had to learn NextJs.

At the moment I have filtered out matches where there can be 3 possible outcomes e.g. football and ice hockey. These may be implmented in the future when I have a better idea of how to restructure the UI.

Hopefully this will conclude my year-long hiatus in making these little side projects and 2023 will bring on more intesterting ideas.

P.S. Blog reader bonus: you can use this token ```dca53290505fd0649137a2e7c7923df8``` to test out the project instead of registering it yourself. However, this is a key in the free tier so a shared usage of 500 requests per month might render this useless. If that is the case, head over to the "Getting started" section for more instructions.
